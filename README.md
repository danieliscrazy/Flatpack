Flatpack is a box that can feel pain. He reacts when he gets punched, yelled at, opened up, or when someone presses his buttons. He uses an Arduino Uno, an analog sound sensor, an analog vibration center, an analog light sensor, and a button. He also uses a computer (my MacBook) to be his voice.

Flatpack was made at Scrapyard New Jersey.
